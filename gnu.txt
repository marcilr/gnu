GNU's Not Unix
GNU is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix!", chosen
because GNU's design is Unix-like, but differs from Unix
by being free software and containing no Unix code.  The
GNU project includes an operating system kernel, GNU HURD,
which was the original focus of the Free Software Foundation 
(FSF).
