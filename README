  GNU's Not Unix
  GNU is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix!", chosen
  because GNU's design is Unix-like, but differs from Unix
  by being free software and containing no Unix code.  The
  GNU project includes an operating system kernel, GNU HURD,
  which was the original focus of the Free Software Foundation
  (FSF).
